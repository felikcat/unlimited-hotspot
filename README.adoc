== About
[.lead]
This guide compared to others -> PDANet, FoxFi, NetShare, EasyTether, Wi-Fi Tether Router, TetherMe, iTether, MyWi, iPhoneModem:

. Supports hotspots from *Android* phones & tablets, *iOS*, *iPadOS*, and *Quectel* modems.
. Methods used are all high performance and reliability, unlike SSH tunneling.
. Fully open-source and free of charge.
- Exception: the non-jailbroken iOS and iPadOS method, not open-source -- but is free of charge.
. On "unlimited" telecom plans, grants you unlimited data for hotspots.
. Moves past various types of throttling, such as limited video quality on YouTube or other streaming services.

== 1. Preparation / Hosting an unlimited hotspot

.Quectel modems
[%collapsible]
====

CAUTION: Never spoof to an IMEI of a device you do not own, it's illegal in the United States, and you will block the device of whoever uses it -- but only if it's on the same telecom.

.Spoof the Quectel modem's IMEI to a phone or tablet you own that has mobile data capability:
* `AT+EGMR=1,7,"The IMEI here"`

====

.Non-jailbroken *iOS* and *iPadOS*
[%collapsible]
====
. https://pairvpn.com/install[Install PairVPN] from the App Store on the iOS or iPadOS device, and on the clients (such as a Windows laptop).

. Connect the client to your iOS/iPadOS device via its "Mobile Hotspot" or through USB tethering.

. Run PairVPN as a server on the iOS/iPadOS device, then use the PairVPN client on devices that connect to that server.
- For as long as PairVPN is used, there won't be hotspot data usage.
- Enable "Share Location" so that PairVPN can run in the background at all times, and also allow PairVPN to send notifications.

====

.Non-rooted *Android*
[%collapsible]
====

. https://github.com/pyamsoft/tetherfi#tetherfi[Install TetherFi] on the Android device.

. Open the TetherFi app.

. Configure the following in the "Hotspot" tab:
- Broadcast frequency -> 5GHz
- Enable all: Wake Locks
- Enable: Bind Proxy to All Interfaces

. Open the "How To" tab and follow its instructions.

====

.Rooted *Android*
[%collapsible]
====

. https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/[Install Magisk].
- For macOS, I recommend using https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] to install ADB using: `brew install android-platform-tools`.
- When it says to "Copy the boot/init_boot/recovery image to your device", that image they're asking for is located in the zip file for the OS you downloaded.
** For the Google Pixel 7 Pro: Extract `image-cheetah-ap3a.241105.007.zip`, then extract `bootloader-cheetah-cloudripper-15.0-11969070.img`. Now there is an `init_boot.img` extracted which can be transferred over to the Pixel phone so you can use Magisk to patch it. Continue to follow the official instructions.

. Download the https://github.com/felikcat/unlimited-hotspot/releases/download/v7/unlimited-hotspot-v7.zip[Unlimited Hotspot] Magisk module.
. Open Magisk -> Modules -> Install from storage -> Select the "unlimited-hotspot-v7.zip" that was downloaded.
. Reboot.

== 2. Moving past throttling

WARNING: If using the PairVPN method, VPNs cannot be used, only anti-DPI applications that operate via proxy. The TetherFi method still allows for VPNs, but requires a VPN that can run off a proxy such as AirVPN. It's recommended to manually configure programs such as the Brave browser with using a proxy, instead of attempting a system-wide proxy; for SpoofDPI this would be running with `-system-proxy false`.

NOTE: https://airvpn.org/[AirVPN] is useful if you require torrenting as it has comprehensive port forwarding support. +
https://mullvad.net[Mullvad] generally has the fastest speeds. +
https://www.mysteriumvpn.com/[Mysterium] or https://resivpn.com/[ResiVPN] is useful if you require residental IPs, or use streaming services that block VPNs. +
- Mysterium is not as fast as AirVPN or Mullvad, while ResiVPN has a very limited selection of locations. +
- https://www.mysteriumdark.com/[Mysterium Dark] lets you pay only by data usage, while https://www.mysteriumvpn.com/[Mysterium] is a subscription model.

TIP: For every macOS or other OS device you use, you'd have to install SpoofDPI (or some other anti-DPI application) on each; they do not have to be the same anti-DPI application.

.Install anti-DPI applications, specific to each OS:

* FreeBSD, OpenBSD: https://github.com/bol-van/zapret/blob/master/docs/bsd.eng.md[zapret].

* macOS and Linux: https://github.com/xvzc/SpoofDPI[SpoofDPI], or https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel#configuring[PowerTunnel]. +
https://github.com/bol-van/zapret/blob/master/docs/readme.eng.md[zapret] exists but has difficulty with Apple chipset macOS (for macOS, use zapret's https://github.com/bol-van/zapret/blob/master/docs/bsd.eng.md[BSD instructions]).
* Windows: https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI[GoodbyeDPI], or https://github.com/macronut/ghostcp[GhosTCP].
* Android: https://github.com/dovecoteescapee/ByeDPIAndroid[ByeDPI]; run it in VPN mode.
* iOS/iPadOS: https://apps.apple.com/in/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627[Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 app]; any other VPNs utilizing WireGuard or OpenVPN work too.

.How to use PowerTunnel on macOS
[%collapsible]
====

. Make sure the https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel/releases[latest PowerTunnel.jar] is downloaded.

. Download the https://adoptium.net/download/[Adoptium installer] and open it.

. After you got done installing Adoptium "Temurin", in *Finder*, kbd:[Left Option] + kbd:[Right Click] PowerTunnel.jar then click "Open". +

=== Additional required steps

.HTTPS "packet chunking" (also called TCP fragmentation) is required to bypass throttling.
[%collapsible]
====

. image:PowerTunnel1.png[480,360]
. Use a low chunk size, such as "1": + 
image:PowerTunnel2.png[480,360]

====

.If using PowerTunnel and TetherFi (for non-rooted Android).
[%collapsible]
====

. Go to PowerTunnel, then click on "Options".
. Configure the upstream proxy server to match what TetherFi says to use. For my case, it was 192.168.49.1 with port 8228 for the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
- image:PowerTunnel3.png[480,360]

====

.macOS
[%collapsible]
====
. https://github.com/felikcat/unlimited-hotspot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[Download Unlimited Hotspot], then open `unlimited-hotspot-main.zip` in *Finder* to extract it.
. After extracted, open the "unlimited-hotspot-main" folder, then open its "macOS" folder.
. Open *Terminal*.

. Type `sudo -i`, enter your login password, then press kbd:[Enter].
. Type `cp` then drag the `set-ios-tcp-stack.sh` file in, press kbd:[Space], type in `/var/root` and press kbd:[Enter].
. Type `cp` then drag the `felikcat.set.ios.tcpstack.plist` file in, press kbd:[Space], type in `/Library/LaunchDaemons` and then press kbd:[Enter].
. `chmod +x /var/root/set-ios-tcp-stack.sh`
. `launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/felikcat.set.ios.tcpstack.plist`

.Now we need to add three Packet Filter rules and enable PF.
. `nano /etc/pf.conf`
. Add the following three lines before `nat-anchor`: +
image:pf_rules.png[]
. `pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf` then `pfctl -e`

=== Routers
For Quectel modems, or if the hotspot device is plugged into a router, then these steps are required:

.Asuswrt-Merlin
[%collapsible]
====
. `Advanced Settings - WAN` -> disable `Extend the TTL value` and `Spoof LAN TTL value`.
. `Advanced Settings - Administration`
- `Enable JFFS custom scripts and configs` -> "Yes"
- `Enable SSH` -> "LAN only"
. Replace the LAN IP and login name if needed: `$ ssh 192.168.50.1 -l asus`
- Use other SSH clients if preferred, such as MobaXterm or Termius.
. `# nano /jffs/scripts/wan-event`

[source, shell]
----
#!/bin/sh
# shellcheck disable=SC2068
Say() {
  printf '%s%s' "$$" "$@" | logger -st "($(basename "$0"))"
}
WAN_IF=$1
WAN_STATE=$2

# Call appropriate script based on script_type
SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME="wan${WAN_IF}-${WAN_STATE}"
SERVICE_SCRIPT_LOG="/tmp/WAN${WAN_IF}_state"

# Execute and log script state
if [ -f "/jffs/scripts/${SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME}" ]; then
  Say "     Script executing.. for wan-event: $SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME"
  echo "$SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME" >"$SERVICE_SCRIPT_LOG"
  sh /jffs/scripts/"${SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME}" "$@"
else
  Say "     Script not defined for wan-event: $SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME"
fi

##@Insert##
----

`# nano /jffs/scripts/wan0-connected`

#!/bin/sh

# HACK: I am unsure of what to check.

== 3. Using dnscrypt2 to get past webpage blocks

TIP: Unnecessary if using a VPN or some anti-DPI programs, be sure to test.

https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Installation[Installation instructions for other OSes], such as Windows, Linux, etc.

.macOS
[%collapsible]
====
. Go to https://ipleak.net/[AirVPN's IP Leak] to see your current DNS servers. Save a screenshot of this page.

. https://brew.sh/[Install Homebrew] if you haven't already.

. `brew install dnscrypt-proxy`

. Be sure to read the information Brew gives you after it's done installing dnscrypt-proxy.
- It is recommended to install dnscrypt-proxy's service.

. Open *Settings*, go to Network, then click on the Network interface you are currently using; for me, that is "USB 10/100/1G/2.5G LAN".
. Click "Details..." +
image:settings_dnscrypt.png[]
. Go to DNS, press the Plus (+) button under "DNS Servers", then type in `127.0.0.1` +
image:settings_dnscrypt_2.png[]

. Go back to https://ipleak.net/[AirVPN's IP Leak] to see if the changes to your DNS servers is successful; compare it to your prior screenshot.

====

== 4. Confirm the hotspot is un-throttled

* Use https://fast.com[Netflix's Speedtest], then compare that result to https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat[Waveform's Bufferbloat Test]. +
- This tests for throttling of streaming servers (Netflix), various forms of data fingerprinting, and hotspot detections.



== 5. Improving internet speeds

.*Android only* -> Enable Data Saver:
* This only works via USB, as it will block wireless hotspots.
- Context: Data saver tells Android to restrict data to only the USB hotspot and which app is at the forefront.

.*Android & iOS/iPadOS & Quectel* -> Disable roaming:
* *Android & iOS*: Search for "Roaming" in the Settings app, then disable it.
- Context: Roaming to a different telecom usually has unavoidable throttling. Roaming kicks in when signal strength is either very poor or non-existent from your telecom. In T-Mobile USA's case, they roam on AT&T with only up to 250kbps download & upload speeds on AT&T's towers.

.*Android & iOS/iPadOS & Quectel* -> Switch cell tower providers specifically for problematic areas
* *Android*: Settings -> Network & internet -> SIMs -> Disable "Automatically select network"
* *iOS*: Context -> T-Mobile owns Sprint's towers. For me, Sprint has consistently better speeds at my home. +
image:ios_network_selection.PNG[width=281.5,height=305]

.*Rooted Android & Quectel* -> Using specific 4G, LTE, 5G NA, or 5G SA bands:
* *Rooted Android*:
. Install https://apkpure.com/netmonster/cz.mroczis.netmonster[NetMonster] for its network monitoring. Without NetMonster, you are blind to what bands are used, and their signal strength.

. Install https://apkpure.com/network-signal-guru/com.qtrun.QuickTest[Network Signal Guru] then use it to set the allowed LTE bands to only the "LTE 4x4 Bands" listed on https://cacombos.com/device/G025E[cacombos.com] for your device. This could stabilize your speeds, and can potentially increase speeds.

. If the ads bother you, enable Systemless Hosts in Magisk's settings, then install https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway/releases[AdAway] and use its Root method; do not use its VPN method.

.*Android only* -> Disable "hotspot hardware acceleration" in the Settings app:
- *Only if* you have high ping or ping spiking issues, otherwise leave it enabled.
